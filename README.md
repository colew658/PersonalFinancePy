An example of this repo's usage is in `demo_notebook.ipynb`.

# Contributing
All contributors must develop within the designated virtual environment which is created by running the `setup.sh` script. This virtual environment installs project dependencies and pre-commit hooks. The `setup.sh` script can be run by the following command:
```bash
foo-bar@baz:~/PersonalFinancePy$ source setup.sh
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
This command must be run in a bash terminal (not zsh, powershell, etc.). This ensures the script works properly regardless of your OS.
